# The App - Details
I used Streamlit for development and deployment of Movie Recommendation System that helps users discover movies they might enjoy based on their ratings. I used top 500 popular movies computed in System #1 to display on WebApplication for user to rate. And used similarity_matrix_top30 for recommending top 10 movies for user based on given ratings.

### Code along with similarity matrix are checked-in on github at -
